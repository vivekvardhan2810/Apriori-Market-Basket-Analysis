# Market Basket Analysis using Apriori Algorithm

## Introduction

This project involves performing Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm. Market Basket Analysis is a popular data mining technique used to identify associations or relationships between products in a large dataset of transactions. The Apriori algorithm is a classic algorithm used to find frequent itemsets and generate association rules.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis consists of transactional data. Each transaction represents a customer's purchase, and the dataset includes multiple transactions. The dataset can be sourced from various places such as retail store records, e-commerce platforms, or publicly available datasets.

### Data Dictionary

The dataset typically includes the following columns:

- `TransactionID`: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- `Item`: The item purchased in the transaction.

Example of a dataset format:
```
TransactionID, Item
1, Bread
1, Milk
1, Butter
2, Bread
2, Milk
3, Milk
3, Butter
```
